# Notes Sharing Platform - UML Diagrams Summary

This document provides an overview of the UML diagrams created for the Notes Sharing Platform. These diagrams illustrate different aspects of the system's architecture, behavior, and structure.

## 1. Class Diagram (`notes_sharing_class_diagram.puml`)

**Purpose:** Illustrates the data model and relationships between the main entities in the system.

**Key Elements:**
- User class with attributes and methods
- Note class with attributes and methods
- Download class with attributes
- Admin class extending User
- Relationships between entities (uploads, performs, has)

**Usage:** Use this diagram to understand the core data model and object relationships in the system.

## 2. Sequence Diagram (`notes_sharing_sequence_diagram.puml`)

**Purpose:** Shows the interactions between different components during key processes.

**Key Processes Illustrated:**
- Note Upload Process
- Note Viewing Process
- Note Download Process

**Usage:** Use this diagram to understand the flow of interactions and the sequence of operations during key user activities.

## 3. Use Case Diagram (`notes_sharing_use_case_diagram.puml`)

**Purpose:** Displays the different user roles and their interactions with the system.

**Key Elements:**
- User roles (Guest, User, Admin)
- Use cases for each role
- Relationships between roles and use cases

**Usage:** Use this diagram to understand the system functionality from the user's perspective and the capabilities available to different user roles.

## 4. Activity Diagram (`notes_sharing_activity_diagram.puml`)

**Purpose:** Illustrates the workflow of key processes in the system.

**Key Processes Illustrated:**
- Note Upload Process
- Note Download Process

**Usage:** Use this diagram to understand the business processes and the flow of activities in the system.

## 5. Component Diagram (`notes_sharing_component_diagram.puml`)

**Purpose:** Shows the architectural structure of the system and how different components interact.

**Key Elements:**
- Client Side components
- Server Side components (Presentation, Application, Data Access layers)
- Storage components
- Interfaces between components

**Usage:** Use this diagram to understand the high-level architecture of the system and the relationships between major components.

## 6. Entity-Relationship Diagram (`notes_sharing_erd.puml`)

**Purpose:** Illustrates the database structure in detail.

**Key Elements:**
- Users table with attributes
- Notes table with attributes
- Downloads table with attributes
- Relationships between tables

**Usage:** Use this diagram to understand the database schema and the relationships between tables.

## 7. Deployment Diagram (`notes_sharing_deployment_diagram.puml`)

**Purpose:** Shows how the system would be deployed in a production environment.

**Key Elements:**
- Client (Web Browser)
- Web Server components
- Database Server components
- File Storage Server components
- Production environment with scalability considerations

**Usage:** Use this diagram to understand the physical architecture of the system and how it would be deployed in a production environment.

## How to View These Diagrams

These diagrams are created using PlantUML, a text-based diagramming tool. To view them:

1. Install PlantUML (https://plantuml.com/starting)
2. Use a PlantUML viewer or plugin for your IDE
3. Alternatively, use the online PlantUML server (http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/uml/)

## Diagram Relationships

These diagrams are complementary and provide different views of the same system:

- The **Class Diagram** and **Entity-Relationship Diagram** show the data model from different perspectives.
- The **Sequence Diagram** and **Activity Diagram** show the system behavior from different viewpoints.
- The **Use Case Diagram** shows the system functionality from the user's perspective.
- The **Component Diagram** and **Deployment Diagram** show the system architecture at different levels of abstraction.

Together, these diagrams provide a comprehensive view of the Notes Sharing Platform's architecture, behavior, and structure.
