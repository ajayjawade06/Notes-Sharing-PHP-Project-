Notes Sharing Platform Documentation

INTRODUCTION
Introduction of project
The Notes Sharing Platform is a web-based application designed to facilitate the sharing of educational notes and resources among users. It provides a centralized platform where users can upload, view, and download various types of documents, including PDF, DOC, DOCX, PPT, PPTX, TXT, ZIP, and RAR files. The platform includes user authentication, note management, view tracking, and download statistics, as well as an administrative interface for system management and reporting.

Existing System and Need for System
Traditional methods of sharing educational notes often involve physical exchanges, email attachments, or disparate online platforms, leading to inefficiencies, limited accessibility, and lack of organization. There is a need for a centralized, user-friendly platform that allows for easy sharing and discovery of educational resources. The Notes Sharing Platform addresses these needs by providing a dedicated system with robust features for uploading, categorizing, searching, and downloading notes, along with user authentication and tracking mechanisms.

The Notes Sharing Platform encompasses the following scope:
1. User registration and authentication system
2. Note upload functionality with support for multiple file formats
3. Note viewing and downloading capabilities
4. View and download tracking
5. User profile management
6. Administrative dashboard for system oversight
7. Reporting and analytics features
8. Responsive user interface for various devices
